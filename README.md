# Optimising Federated Learning for Wound Recognition: A Study on Aggregation Strategies and Deployment Scenario
A joint study between AITIS Research & City, University of London

This study investigates the potential of Federated Learning (FL) for wound recognition in medical imaging, addressing the small sample size dilemma and data privacy concerns. Driven by AITIS's aim for a privacy-centric wound recognition system, the research contrasts FL strategies with traditional centralised deep learning, centring on aggregation methods and deployment contexts. The evaluation highlighted FedProx as a top-performing FL strategy. FL methods also showed comparable performance to models trained using centralised training. The study also emphasised the environmentdependent efficiency of FL techniques, with varied performance in hospital and obile app settings. This research underscores FL's real-world applicability, championing its robustness in wound segmentation cases.
